# Battleship Game

Welcome to the Battleship game! This is a simple Python implementation of the classic game Battleship. The game is played on an 8x8 grid where you try to sink hidden battleships by guessing their locations.

## How to Play

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer.

3. Run the `battleship.py` script to start the game.

4. You will be presented with an empty 8x8 grid. The goal is to sink all the hidden battleships.

5. Enter your guesses by specifying the row (1-8) and column (A-H) where you want to fire your shot.

6. The game will inform you if your guess was a hit or a miss.

7. Keep playing until you sink all the battleships or run out of turns.

## Game Rules

There are 5 hidden battleships on the grid:

- One carrier (5 holes)
- One battleship (4 holes)
- One destroyer (3 holes)
- One submarine (3 holes)
- One patrol boat (2 holes)

## Files

- `battleship.py`: The main Python script for the game.
- `README.md`: This file, providing instructions and information about the game.

## Customize the Game

You can customize the game by modifying the `length_of_ships` list in the `battleship.py` script to change the lengths of the hidden battleships. You can also make other changes to the game logic if you wish.
